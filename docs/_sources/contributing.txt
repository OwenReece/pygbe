Developer's Guide
=================

Welcome to PyGBe's developer's guide! This is a place to keep track of
information that does not belong in a regular userguide.

Contributing to PyGBe
---------------------

All code must go through the pull request review procedure.
If you want to add something to PyGBe, first fork the repository. Make
your changes on your fork of the repository and then open a pull request
with your changes against the main PyGBe repository.

New features should follow the following rules: 1. PEP8 style guide
should be followed 2. New features should include unit tests 3. All
functions should have NumPy style doctrings. See
`here <https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/doc/HOWTO_DOCUMENT.rst.txt>`_
for reference)

Running the tests
-----------------

PyGBe currently only has regression tests.
Once everything is installed, you can navigate to
``pygbe/tests/regression_tests``.
To run any of the regression tests individually, just run the
corresponding script.

::

    python lysozyme.py

or to run all of the tests, use the helper script

::

    python run_all_regression_tests.py

Generating documentation
------------------------

Ensure ``sphinx`` is installed.

::

    $ pip install sphinx
    $ conda install sphinx

Once you have added docstrings to some new functions, first reinstall
PyGBe using either

::

    $ python setup.py install

or

::

    $ python setup.py develop

In the root of ``pygbe`` run

::

    $ sphinx-apidoc -f -o docs/source pygbe

Then enter the docs folder and run ``make``

::

    $ cd docs
    $ make html

Ensure that the docs have built correctly and that formatting, etc, is
functional by opening the local docs in your browser

::

    firefox _build/html/index.html

If there are any errors in the build (or warnings), then fix them. If
there are no errors and the docs look good on your local build, then
you're done! Open a PR with your changes and when it is merged, the
changes to the documentation will be automatically built and pushed by
Travis to the ``gh-pages`` branch.
